Sorting Algorithms &amp; Big O

Description
This project covers a variety of sorting algorithms implemented in C. Each sorting algorithm is tested to demonstrate how it behaves in terms of time complexity and efficiency. The goal is to learn the implementation of sorting algorithms and analyze their performance in terms of Big O notation.

Algorithms Implemented
The following sorting algorithms are implemented in this project:
Bubble Sort
Selection Sort
Insertion Sort
Merge Sort
Quick Sort
Heap Sort
Radix Sort (if applicable)
Counting Sort (if applicable)
Each algorithm is implemented in its own C file, with functions for sorting arrays of integers and displaying the sorted arrays.

Usage
Each sorting algorithm is defined as a function that takes an array and its size as parameters.

Time Complexities
Here is a brief summary of the time complexities of each algorithm:

Bubble Sort:
Worst and Average Case: O(n²)

Best Case (already sorted): O(n)

Selection Sort:
Worst, Best, and Average Case: O(n²)

Insertion Sort:
Worst and Average Case: O(n²)
Best Case (already sorted): O(n)

Merge Sort:
Worst, Best, and Average Case: O(n log n)

Quick Sort:
Worst Case (pivot selection): O(n²)
Best and Average Case: O(n log n)

Heap Sort:
Worst, Best, and Average Case: O(n log n)

Radix Sort (if implemented):
Time complexity: O(nk), where k is the number of digits in the largest number

Counting Sort (if implemented):
Time complexity: O(n + k), where n is the number of elements and k is the range of input values.

This README template provides the basic structure for your Sorting Algorithms & Big O project. It covers what the project is about, the algorithms you've implemented, and provides instructions for setup and usage. You can further expand sections based on any specific needs, such as adding more detailed explanations of the algorithms or adding specific test cases. Let me know if you'd like to adjust any part!
